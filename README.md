tips you should know about COCO dataset:

1. COCO have three types of annotations including captions,keypoints and instances. we just use instances annotations to have 
bounding boxes in the image.

2. The annotations file including image_info_test2014/2015.json,image_info_test-dev2015.json,instances_train2014/val2014.json.
and we just use instances_train2014/val2014.jsonï¼Œthe other three annotation files just have image paths and don't have bounding boxes.

3. Information about instances_train2014/val2014.json,you should look at the COCO website.
